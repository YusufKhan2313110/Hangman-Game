    <h1>Hangman Game Instructions:</h1>
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <pre>Welcome to the Hangman game! The objective is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters. 
        Each incorrect guess brings you closer to completing the hangman figure, so be 
        strategic and try to solve the word before it's too late.
    </pre>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Look at the blank spaces representing each letter in the word.</li>
        <li>Enter a letter into the input field and click the "Guess" button.</li>
        <li>If the letter is in the word, it will fill in the corresponding blank spaces.</li>
        <li>If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman figure will be added.</li>
        <li>Continue guessing until you either solve the word or complete the hangman.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can only guess one letter at a time</li>
        <li>The hangman figure has six parts. Guess carefully!</li>
        <li>Pay attention to the wrong guesses displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scoring:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The faster you guess the word, the higher your score.</li>
        <li>Try to solve the word with the fewest incorrect guesses for the best score.</li>
    </ul>
